# new-york-city-bike
#### BI Analyst:  Anh Nguyen

#### Client/Sponsor: Cyclistic – a fictional bike_share company in New York city

#### Purpose: (Briefly describe why the project is happening and why the company should invest resources in it.)
Cyclistic’s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year.
The team want to understand how their customer are using their bikes and top prority is identifying customer demand at the different station location.
How can apply insights from data generated by trip data.

#### Key dependencies: (Detail the major elements of this project. Include the team, primary contacts, and expected deliverables.)

Team member: 
Adhira Patel, API Strategist
Megan Pirato, Data Wherehousing Specialist
Rick Andersson, Manager, Data Governance
Tessa Blackwell, Data Analyst
Branne Sand, Director, IT
Shareefah, Project Manager

#### Primary contracts: Adhira, Megan, Rick and Tessa.

Per Sara: Dashboard needs to be accessible, with large print and text-to-speech alternatives.

#### Stakeholder requirements: (List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R - required, D - desired, or N - nice to have.)
Understand what customer want, What makes a successful product, How new stations might alleviate demand in different geographical areas.
Understand how the current line of bikes are used.
How can we apply customer usage insights to inform new station growth.
The customer growth team wants to understand how different user (subscribers and non subscribers) use bikes.
Investagate a large group of users to get a fair representation of users across location and with low to high- activity levels.
Keep in mind users might use Cyclistic less then the weather is inclement. This should be visible in dashboard.

#### Success criteria: (Clarify what success looks like for this project. Include explicit statements about how to measure success. Use SMART criteria.) 
Analtze data that spans at least one year to see how seasonality affects usage.
Exloring data that splans multiple months will capture peacks and valleys in usage.
Evaluate each trip on the mumber of rides per starting location and per day/ month/ year to uderstand the trends.
Example:
Do customer use Cyclist less with rains?
Does bikeshare demand stay consistent?
Does this vary by location and user types ( subscribers vs non subscribers)
User these outcomes to find our more about what impacts customer demand.

#### User journeys: (Document the current user experience and the ideal future experience.)
The deliverables and metrics:
A table or map visulization exploring starting and ending station locations, aggregated by location.
User can user any location identifier, such as station, zip code, neighborhood, and/or borough.
Show the number of trips at starting locations.
	Can show either table or map. For a table, could include just starting locations or a combination of starting and ending location
A visualization showing which destination (ending) locations are popupar base in the total trips minute.
	Focus on peak month
A visualization that focuses on the trends from the summer of 2015.
A visualization showing the percent growth in the number of trips year over year.
Gather insights about number of trips across all starting and ending locations.
Gather insights about peak usage by time of data, season and the impact of weather.
Dashboard must be create in 6 weeks.

#### Other considerations:
The data set includes latitude and longitude of stations but does not identify more geographic aggregation details, such as zip code, neighborhood name or borough. Client will provide as separate database with this data.
The weather data provided does not included what time percipitation occurred. Its possible that on some days, it percipitated during off- peak hours. However, for the purpose of this dashboard,, I should assume any amount of percipitation that occurred on the day of the trip cound have an impact. 
Starting bike trips at a location will be impossible if there are no bike available at the station, so we might need to consider other factors for demand. 

#### Assumptions: (Explicitly and clearly state any assumptions you are making.)
How to organize the various points and steps
How to group similar topics
Whether the information is relevant to the project
Whether the metrics are effective or not.
Compliance and privacy: (Include compliance, privacy, or legal dimensions to consider.)
The data much not include any personal infor (name, emails, phone, address). Personal info is not necessary for the project .
Anomynize users to avoild bias and protect their privacy.
Accessibility: (List key considerations for creating accessible reports for all users.)
People with dashboard- viewing privileges:
Adhira, Brianne, Ernest, Jamal, Megan, Ninan, Rick, Shareefah, Sara, Tessa

#### Roll-out plan: (Detail the expected scope, priorities and timeline.)
Week 1: Dataset assigned. Initial design for fields and Bike IDS validated to fit the requirments.
Week 2-3 : SQL and ETL development.
Week 3-4: Finaize SQL. Dashboard design. 1st draft review with peers
Week 5-6: Dash board development and testing

# PROCESS
## Ensure Data Integrity
 ensure the data is clean, consistent, and free from errors.
 #### Check for Missing Values
Identify columns with missing or null values.
```
COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    COUNT(usertype) AS usertype_missing,
    COUNT(zip_code_start) AS zip_code_start_missing,
    COUNT(borough_start) AS borough_start_missing,
    COUNT(neighborhood_start) AS neighborhood_start_missing,
    COUNT(zip_code_end) AS zip_code_end_missing,
    COUNT(borough_end) AS borough_end_missing,
    COUNT(neighborhood_end) AS neighborhood_end_missing,
    COUNT(start_day) AS start_day_missing,
    COUNT(stop_day) AS stop_day_missing,
    COUNT(day_mean_temperature) AS day_mean_temperature_missing,
    COUNT(day_mean_wind_speed) AS day_mean_wind_speed_missing,
    COUNT(day_total_precipitation) AS day_total_precipitation_missing,
    COUNT(trip_minutes) AS trip_minutes_missing,
    COUNT(trip_count) AS trip_count_missing
FROM `deductive-wares-447204-s0.biketrip.bike_trip`;
````
There is not columns with missing or null values.
#### Check for Duplicates
  Identify duplicate rows based on unique identifiers (e.g., trip ID or a combination of columns).
  ```
SELECT 
    usertype, zip_code_start, borough_start, neighborhood_start, 
    zip_code_end, borough_end, neighborhood_end, start_day, stop_day, 
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM `deductive-wares-447204-s0.biketrip.bike_trip`
GROUP BY 
    usertype, zip_code_start, borough_start, neighborhood_start, 
    zip_code_end, borough_end, neighborhood_end, start_day, stop_day
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
there are 622588 rows have dublicate value
#### Remove dublicate rows from tables
```
SELECT 
    usertype, 
    zip_code_start, 
    borough_start, 
    neighborhood_start, 
    zip_code_end,

            zip_code_end, borough_end, neighborhood_end, start_day, stop_day
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    );
```
#### Validate Data Types
Ensure all columns have the correct data types (e.g., trip_minutes should be numeric, start_day and stop_day should be dates).
```
SELECT 
    COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
FROM `deductive-wares-447204-s0.biketrip.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'bike_trip';
```
#### Check for Outliers
Identify outliers in numeric columns like trip_minutes, day_mean_temperature, etc.
```
SELECT 
    MIN(trip_minutes) AS min_trip_minutes,
    MAX(trip_minutes) AS max_trip_minutes,
    AVG(trip_minutes) AS avg_trip_minutes,
    MIN(day_mean_temperature) AS min_temperature,
    MAX(day_mean_temperature) AS max_temperature,
    AVG(day_mean_temperature) AS avg_temperature
FROM`deductive-wares-447204-s0.biketrip.bike_trip`;
```
#### Validate Zip Codes
```
SELECT 
    zip_code_start, zip_code_end
FROM `deductive-wares-447204-s0.biketrip.bike_trip`
WHERE LENGTH(zip_code_start) != 5 OR LENGTH(zip_code_end) != 5;
