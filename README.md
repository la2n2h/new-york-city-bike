# new-york-city-bike
#### BI Analyst:  Anh Nguyen

#### Client/Sponsor: Cyclistic – a fictional bike_share company in New York city

#### Purpose: (Briefly describe why the project is happening and why the company should invest resources in it.)
Cyclistic’s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year.
The team want to understand how their customer are using their bikes and top prority is identifying customer demand at the different station location.
How can apply insights from data generated by trip data.

#### Key dependencies: (Detail the major elements of this project. Include the team, primary contacts, and expected deliverables.)

Team member: 
Adhira Patel, API Strategist
Megan Pirato, Data Wherehousing Specialist
Rick Andersson, Manager, Data Governance
Tessa Blackwell, Data Analyst
Branne Sand, Director, IT
Shareefah, Project Manager

#### Primary contracts: Adhira, Megan, Rick and Tessa.

Per Sara: Dashboard needs to be accessible, with large print and text-to-speech alternatives.

#### Stakeholder requirements: (List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R - required, D - desired, or N - nice to have.)
Understand what customer want, What makes a successful product, How new stations might alleviate demand in different geographical areas.
Understand how the current line of bikes are used.
How can we apply customer usage insights to inform new station growth.
The customer growth team wants to understand how different user (subscribers and non subscribers) use bikes.
Investagate a large group of users to get a fair representation of users across location and with low to high- activity levels.
Keep in mind users might use Cyclistic less then the weather is inclement. This should be visible in dashboard.

#### Success criteria: (Clarify what success looks like for this project. Include explicit statements about how to measure success. Use SMART criteria.) 
Analtze data that spans at least one year to see how seasonality affects usage.
Exloring data that splans multiple months will capture peacks and valleys in usage.
Evaluate each trip on the mumber of rides per starting location and per day/ month/ year to uderstand the trends.
Example:
Do customer use Cyclist less with rains?
Does bikeshare demand stay consistent?
Does this vary by location and user types ( subscribers vs non subscribers)
User these outcomes to find our more about what impacts customer demand.

#### User journeys: (Document the current user experience and the ideal future experience.)
The deliverables and metrics:
A table or map visulization exploring starting and ending station locations, aggregated by location.
User can user any location identifier, such as station, zip code, neighborhood, and/or borough.
Show the number of trips at starting locations.
	Can show either table or map. For a table, could include just starting locations or a combination of starting and ending location
A visualization showing which destination (ending) locations are popupar base in the total trips minute.
	Focus on peak month
A visualization that focuses on the trends from the summer of 2015.
A visualization showing the percent growth in the number of trips year over year.
Gather insights about number of trips across all starting and ending locations.
Gather insights about peak usage by time of data, season and the impact of weather.
Dashboard must be create in 6 weeks.

#### Other considerations:
The data set includes latitude and longitude of stations but does not identify more geographic aggregation details, such as zip code, neighborhood name or borough. Client will provide as separate database with this data.
The weather data provided does not included what time percipitation occurred. Its possible that on some days, it percipitated during off- peak hours. However, for the purpose of this dashboard,, I should assume any amount of percipitation that occurred on the day of the trip cound have an impact. 
Starting bike trips at a location will be impossible if there are no bike available at the station, so we might need to consider other factors for demand. 

#### Assumptions: (Explicitly and clearly state any assumptions you are making.)
How to organize the various points and steps
How to group similar topics
Whether the information is relevant to the project
Whether the metrics are effective or not.
Compliance and privacy: (Include compliance, privacy, or legal dimensions to consider.)
The data much not include any personal infor (name, emails, phone, address). Personal info is not necessary for the project .
Anomynize users to avoild bias and protect their privacy.
Accessibility: (List key considerations for creating accessible reports for all users.)
People with dashboard- viewing privileges:

##  Gain Data Insights
#### Identify the distribution of user types (e.g., subscribers vs. casual users).
```
SELECT 
    usertype, COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM `deductive-wares-447204-s0.biketrip.bike_trip`
GROUP BY usertype;
```
| usertype   | user_count |
|------------|------------|
| Subscriber | 1589760    |
| Customer   | 648443     |


The number of Subscribers (1,589,760) is significantly higher than the number of Customers (648,443). This suggests that a large proportion of people using the bike-sharing service are regular or repeat users, indicating strong customer retention or a high number of loyal subscribers.
While the subscriber base is large, the Customer group (648,443) may present an opportunity for growth, particularly if efforts can be made to convert customers into subscribers.
It could be worth investigating what percentage of customers convert to subscribers over time and identifying ways to increase this conversion.

Possible Insights on Popular Start and End Locations:

Popular Start Locations:

Chelsea and Clinton, Gramercy Park and Murray Hill, and Lower Manhattan are likely central hubs or areas with major destinations, indicating a strong demand for bike trips originating in these locations.
These neighborhoods could be commercial or residential hotspots with high bike usage, possibly near transit hubs, offices, or recreational areas.

Popular End Locations:
The pattern of end counts suggests that some neighborhoods like Greenpoint and Tribeca might be more common destinations for trips rather than starting points. This might indicate that people are using these neighborhoods as "final stop" locations after traveling from more central areas.

Neighborhoods with a High Start-to-End Ratio:
Northwest Brooklyn has a relatively higher start count (147,875) than its end count (152,972). This could indicate that bikes are being used more as a means of transport out of this neighborhood towards other parts of the city.
Upper West Side and Upper East Side also show relatively higher start counts than end counts, which may suggest that many bike trips either start or end in these neighborhoods but don’t necessarily complete their full journey within the same area.

Potential Areas for Improvement or Targeted Marketing:
Greenpoint and Tribeca could benefit from marketing or infrastructure changes to make them more attractive as starting locations for bike trips. For example, these areas might be experiencing higher demand from people traveling from other areas into them.
Consider increasing availability or accessibility in these areas (such as more bike stations or promotions) to encourage more start counts in these neighborhoods.

Possible Traffic and Infrastructure Implications:
Popular neighborhoods for both start and end trips (like Chelsea and Clinton) may need to consider capacity and traffic management strategies to accommodate the high number of trips.
Conversely, neighborhoods with high end counts but low start counts may want to ensure they have enough bike-sharing stations or incentives to balance the flow of bike usage.


#### Trip Duration Analysis
```
SELECT 
    AVG(trip_minutes) AS avg_trip_duration,
    MIN(trip_minutes) AS min_trip_duration,
    MAX(trip_minutes) AS max_trip_duration
FROM `deductive-wares-447204-s0.biketrip.bike_trip`;
```
| avg_trip_duration | min_trip_duration | max_trip_duration |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 37.56476513       | 0                 | 97740             |

While the average trip duration of 37.56 minutes seems reasonable, the presence of 0-minute and 97,740-minute trip durations indicates that the dataset might contain anomalies or errors. Cleaning the data by removing outliers will give you more meaningful insights into typical trip behavior and how the bike-sharing system is being used.

#### Weather Impact on Trips

Higher Temperatures Lead to More Trips: Days with temperatures between 60–75°F tend to have the highest average trip counts, suggesting that moderate temperatures are ideal for biking.
Wind Speed: Wind seems to have a relatively minor impact on bike trips, but very high winds (e.g., 7.1 mph) can reduce bike usage slightly.
Precipitation: Light precipitation has a small negative effect on bike usage, but it doesn’t completely deter people from biking.
Ideal Conditions: The most optimal days for bike trips seem to be mild temperature, light winds, and no precipitation.

ORDER BY trip_count DESC;
```
| borough_start | borough_end | trip_count |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Manhattan     | Manhattan   | 1823858    |
| Brooklyn      | Brooklyn    | 139795     |

| Brooklyn      | Queens      | 1885       |
| Queens        | Queens      | 1417       |

Manhattan sees the highest number of bike trips, especially local trips within the borough (Manhattan to Manhattan), indicating that it is a major hub for bike-share usage.
Brooklyn and Manhattan are strongly connected, with a high number of trips going back and forth between the two boroughs, suggesting a high level of inter-borough travel.
Queens is somewhat less connected to both Manhattan and Brooklyn, with fewer bike trips between these boroughs. Additionally, intra-borough trips within Queens are lower than those in Manhattan and Brooklyn, possibly due to less demand or infrastructure.
Intra-borough trips: Manhattan leads in local bike trips, followed by Brooklyn. The relatively low number of intra-borough trips in Queens suggests that bike-share services might not be as integrated or popular within that borough.

Cold Weather and Longer Trips: On very cold days, bike trips tend to be longer, possibly due to fewer riders but those who do bike may take longer trips.
Wind Speeds Affect Duration: High wind speeds can lead to longer bike trips, as riders may take more time or alternate routes to avoid high-wind areas. Low wind speeds generally result in quicker, shorter trips.
Precipitation Shortens Trips: High precipitation (heavy rain or snow) tends to discourage biking, leading to shorter trip durations due to fewer people riding or slower biking speeds in wet conditions.
Ideal Weather for Shorter Trips: Moderate temperatures (in the 50s-70s), low wind speeds, and no precipitation are likely the ideal conditions for shorter bike trips. People may take advantage of the good weather for casual or recreational biking.

Manhattan is the primary hub for both Customers and Subscribers, but Subscribers use the bike-share service significantly more than Customers.
Subscribers use the system consistently across boroughs, while Customers primarily use it in Manhattan.
There is a noticeable trip-count gap between Customers and Subscribers, indicating that Subscribers are more likely to use bike-share services regularly, while Customers use it more sporadically or for leisure.
Queens and Brooklyn have lower trip counts, particularly for Customers, suggesting potential for increasing bike-sharing demand and infrastructure improvements in these boroughs.


# Conclusion
It might be useful to explore the usage patterns between Subscribers and Customers. For example, do Subscribers use the service at peak hours (such as morning commutes) more than Customers?
Offering promotions or discounts to Customers may encourage them to try a subscription, which could increase long-term engagement and user retention.

Infrastructure Expansion: If bike-share services are being planned or improved, focusing on increasing infrastructure (like bike stations) in Queens and between Queens and Brooklyn could help boost cross-borough trips and increase bike usage.

Promotion of Cross-Borough Travel: To further encourage bike usage, there may be a need to promote bike-share options for commuters traveling between Manhattan and Brooklyn, as this is a significant flow of trips. This could include discounts or promotions for commuters using bikes between these boroughs.

Targeted Marketing for Brooklyn and Queens: Based on the lower trip counts for Brooklyn and Queens (compared to Manhattan), targeted marketing efforts in these boroughs could help raise awareness and improve bike-share adoption.
